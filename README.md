# Matran
A collection of functions and classes for importing and visualising Nastran bulk data entries and results. 

**This repository is currently under development and is not ready for general use. Any feedback is much appreciated!**

Moving forward the intention is to also add the ability to write to bdf files so that this tool can be used to read / write generic nastran files.

## Getting Started

- Either clone or download the repository and run `add_sandbox.m` to add the necessary package folders to the path.
- have a look at the examples in the 'Examples' folder to get a flavour of what you can currently do.

### Prerequisites

The following MATLAB products are required to run the Matran package:

- MATLAB 9.4

### Installing as a package
**The ability to pacakge Matran as a MATLAB toolbox will be added in future releases.**
- If you wish to install Matran as a package then run `package_matran.m` to package the codebase.
- This will cause the latest version of the package to appear in the `releases` subfolder as a MATLAB package file. 
- Then install the package using the standard MATLAB process. (Apps >> Install App)

## Running the tests
Make sure you have run `add_sandbox` before attempting to run any of the tests.

- To run the core set of tests type `run_micro_tests` in the MATLAB command window.
- To run all short tests type `run_short_tests` in the MATLAB command window.
- To run all tests in the test framework type `run('TestMatran')` in the MATLAB command window. **Not reccommended**
